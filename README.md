# InstaReplica

Yet another replica of Instagram, to see how well I can go with Flutter! (It is highly convenient btw. Period.)

## What's replicated?
* Post UI (as it looks)
* Double Tap to Like Animation
* Like: state management

## TODO
* Add other interactions (liking with the button, and just showing Snackbar for other options)
* Ummm, I'll think later
